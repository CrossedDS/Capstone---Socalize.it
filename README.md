This app was built with HTML5, CCS3, Bootstrap 3, JavaScript, and jQuery 3.2.1.

HTML5 and Bootstrap were used to code the interface, with Bootstrap’s grid system and well providing the full responsiveness of the app. Bootstrap was also used for the navbar, search form, “About Me” modal, and the “Back To Top” button.

JavaScript and jQuery were used for the JSON request and to build the news template, code the search feature, and to fade in the “Back To Top” button after 20 pixels of scrolling down.
